abstract: >-
  DCRMR is one of several manuals providing specialized
  cataloging rules for various formats of rare materials
  typically found in rare book, manuscript, and special
  collections repositories. Together, these manuals form
  Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials (DCRM), an
  overarching concept rather than a publication in its own
  right. DCRMR is aligned with the RDA element set. When
  completed, DCRMR will be an integrated and consolidated
  manual, which will include instructions for rare materials
  in multiple formats (e.g., music, serials).
