## 5.325.1 Element information

<a name="5.325.1.1">5.325.1.1</a> [Link to RDA Toolkit](https://access.rdatoolkit.org/Content/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-61a1d2e6-9672-36d4-a7b5-c1e37f685797){:target="_blank"}

<a name="5.325.1.2">5.325.1.2</a> [Sources of information](/DCRMR/ppdm/#5011-sources-of-information)

## 5.325.2 RDA definition and scope

<a name="5.325.2.1">5.325.2.1</a> A nomen that is a name of manufacturer in another language or script.

## 5.325.3 General rule

<a name="5.325.3.1">5.325.3.1</a> Take parallel manufacturers’ names from the same source as the [Name of manufacturer](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-manufacturer/). Make a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement) on parallel manufacturers’ names found elsewhere if considered important (see [5.34.35.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.35.1)).

>**Example:**  
>Name of manufacturer: <CITE>Excudebat Joannes Baskerville</CITE>  
>Parallel name of manufacturer: <CITE>By John Baskerville</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: The text in Latin appears first on the title page. The [Parallel place of manufacture](/DCRMR/ppdm/Parallel-place-of-manufacture/) is “Printed at Birmingham”)

<a name="5.325.3.2">5.325.3.2</a> For transposed elements, always make a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement) to indicate the original position on the source (see [5.34.34.7](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.34.7)). 

<a name="5.325.3.3">5.325.3.3</a> If the manufacturer’s name  appears in more than one language or script, transcribe the name in the language or script of the [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper) as [Name of manufacturer](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-manufacturer/). If this criterion does not apply, transcribe the name of manufacturer that appears first as [Name of manufacturer](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-manufacturer/).

<a name="5.325.3.4">5.325.3.4</a> Transcribe remaining manufacturer names appearing on the same source as the [Name of manufacturer](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-manufacturer/) as Parallel names of manufacturer. If a parallel name of manufacturer is from a different source than the [Name of manufacturer](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-manufacturer/), make a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement) if considered important (see [5.34.35.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.35.1)).

<a name="5.325.3.5">5.325.3.5</a> *Optionally*, if the parallel manufacturers' names are considered too numerous to list exhaustively and some may be omitted without significant loss of identification, all after the third may be omitted. Supply in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the nature of the omitted information. Include the number of omitted names in the supplied phrase. Do not use the mark of omission.
