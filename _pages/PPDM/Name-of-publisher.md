<a name="4.203.7.2">4.203.7.2</a>  Optionally, if it is considered that the names are too numerous to list exhaustively, and that some may be omitted without significant loss of identification, the [publication statement](/DCRMR/docs/ppdm/Publication-statement/) may be shortened by omitting all the names after the third. In such cases, use the mark of omission and supply after it in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the extent of the omission.

Example: `Oliver Ditson & Co., C.H. Ditson & Co., Lyon & Healy [and 4 others]`

Example: `Published by the Surveyor General, pursuant to an act of the legislature, Stone & Clark, republishers, 1839`

<a name="4.203.7.4">4.203.7.4</a>  If both the place and publisher associated with an earlier edition appear together with the place and publisher of the edition being described, transcribe each publisher with the place to which it corresponds.

Example: `London : Printed for Knight and Lacy, Paternoster-Row ; Greenfield, Mass. : Re-printed by Ansel Phelps, and for sale by him at his bookstore, also by West & Richardson, Cummings, Hilliard & Co., Boston, and Wilder & Campbell, New-York`

## 4.203.8 Names of publishers in multipart monographs 

<a name="4.203.8.1">4.203.8.1</a>  If the manifestation is issued in more than one physical part and the name or form of name of the publisher changes in the course of publication, transcribe the [publication statement](/docs/ppdm/Publication-statement/) of the first or earliest part and give the [publication statement](/docs/ppdm/Publication-statement/) of the later part(s) in a note. See [note on publication statement](/DCRMR/docs/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/).

## 4.203.9 Supplied and conjectured names of publishers

<a name="4.203.9.1">4.203.9.1</a> If no name, address, or device of a publisher appears on the manifestation, supply the name of the publisher in square brackets if known. If the responsibility of a publisher for a particular manifestation is conjectured, either add a question mark to any supplied name or give the information in a note. In any case of a supplied publisher give supporting evidence in a note. See [note on publication statement](/DCRMR/docs/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/).

Example: `[Anton Koberger]`

**Note on Publication Statement**: `Imprint from Goff.`

## 4.203.95 No supplied name of publisher

<a name="4.203.95.1">4.203.95.1</a> If no publisher’s name can be conjectured, record “publisher not identified” in square brackets.

## 4.203.96 Publisher transcribed as part of another element 

<a name="4.203.96.1">4.203.96.1</a> If no formal publisher’s name statement appears on the manifestation, and the name of the publisher has already been transcribed as part of another element, supply it within square brackets.

Example: `[Paris] : [Pour Symo[n] Vostre Libraire par Philippe Pigouchet.]

*Comment*: Title reads “Ces presentes heures a lusaige de Ro[m]me : so[n]t au lo[n]g sa[n]s req[ue]rir [et] ont este faictes pour Symo[n] Vostre Libraire: demourent a Paris a la rue neuue nostre dame, a lenseigne Sainct Iehan leuangeliste par Philippe Pigouchet.”

## 4.203.97 Publisher name in more than one language or script

<a name="4.203.97.1">4.203.97.1</a>  If the name of the publisher appears in more than one language or script, transcribe the statement in the language or script of the title proper, or if this criterion does not apply, transcribe the statement that appears first. Transcribe the remaining statement(s) as parallel statements (see [Parallel name of publisher](/DCRMR/docs/ppdm/Parallel-name-of-publisher/).  Make a note to indicate the original position on the source of any transposed statements, See [note on publication statement](DCRMR/docs/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/).
