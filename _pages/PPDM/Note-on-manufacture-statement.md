<a name="5.34.36.3">5.34.36.3</a> **Fictitious and incorrect dates**.

<a name="5.34.36.8">5.34.36.8</a> **Date of manufacture in multipart monographs**. Record the date of each volume in a Note on manufacture statement if considered important. Such a Note on manufacture statement is particularly useful when the order of manufacture does not correspond to the order of the volume numeration (see [Date of manufacture, 5.33.355.2](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-manufacture/#5.33.355.2)).

>**Example:**  
><CITe>This is ostensibly an English printing as the manifestation contains press figures, which is an English trait, and its signatures are centred in the direction line. It is an almost identical copy of the seventh London edition, dated 1779, the main differences being there are no catchwords and the use of French ornaments. It is likely a piracy, printed by an English printer employed by Besongne in Rouen</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: The imprint reads “Rouen, printed for JJ. Besongne, book-seller, in Grosse Horloge's street, M.DCC.LXXXI")
