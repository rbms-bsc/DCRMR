## 5.275.1 Element information

<a name="5.275.1.1">5.275.1.1</a> [Link to RDA Toolkit](https://access.rdatoolkit.org/Content/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-fe253018-c149-3a20-9fdb-c9c17faa0ac0){:target="_blank"}

<a name="5.275.1.2">5.275.1.2</a> [Sources of information](/DCRMR/ppdm/#5011-sources-of-information)

## 5.275.2 RDA definition and scope

<a name="5.275.2.1">5.275.2.1</a> A nomen that is a name of distributor in another language or script.

## 5.275.3 General rule

<a name="5.275.3.1">5.275.3.1</a> Take parallel distributors’ names from the same source as the [Name of distributor](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-distributor/). Make a [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/) for  parallel distributors’ names found elsewhere if considered important (see [5.285.35.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.35.1)).

>**Example:**  
>Name of distributor: <CITE>Prostant apud S. Baker, T. Cadell, D. Wilson, G. Nicol, et J. Murray</CITE>  
>Parallel name of distributor: <CITE>By S. Baker and G. Leigh, in York-Street; T. Cadell in the Strand; D. Wilson and G. Nicol, opposite York-Buildings; and J. Murray, in Fleet-Street</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: The text in Latin appears first on the title page. The [Parallel place of distribution](/DCRMR/ppdm/Parallel-place-of-distribution/) is “Sold in London”)

<a name="5.275.3.2">5.275.3.2</a> For transposed elements, always make a [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/) to indicate the original position on the source (see [5.285.34.7](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.34.7)). 

<a name="5.275.3.3">5.275.3.3</a> If the distributor’s name  appears in more than one language or script, transcribe the name in the language or script of the [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper) as [Name of distributor](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-distributor/). If this criterion does not apply, transcribe the name of distributor that appears first as [Name of distributor](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-distributor/).

<a name="5.275.3.4">5.275.3.4</a> Transcribe remaining distributor names appearing on the same source as [Name of distributor](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-distributor/) as Parallel names of distributor. If a parallel name of distributor is from a different source than the [Name of distributor](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-distributor/), make a [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/) if considered important (see [5.285.35.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.35.1)).

<a name="5.275.3.5">5.275.3.5</a> *Optionally*, if the parallel distributors' names are considered too numerous to list exhaustively and some may be omitted without significant loss of identification, all after the third may be omitted. Supply in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the nature of the omitted information. Include the number of omitted names in the supplied phrase. Do not use the mark of omission.
