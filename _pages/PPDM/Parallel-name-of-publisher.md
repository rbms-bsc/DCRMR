<a name="5.225.1.2">5.225.1.2</a> [Sources of information](/DCRMR/ppdm/#5011-sources-of-information)

## 5.225.2 RDA definition and scope

<a name="5.225.2.1">5.225.2.1</a> A nomen that is a name of publisher in another language or script.

## 5.225.3 General rule

<a name="5.225.3.1">5.225.3.1</a> Take parallel publishers’ names from the same source as the [Name of publisher](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-publisher/). Make a [Note on publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement) on parallel publishers’ names found elsewhere if considered important (see [5.24.35.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#5.24.35.1)).

<a name="5.225.3.2">5.225.3.2</a> For transposed elements, always make a [Note on publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement) to indicate the original position on the source (see [5.24.34.7](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#5.24.34.7)).

<a name="5.225.3.3">5.225.3.3</a> If the publisher’s name  appears in more than one language or script, transcribe the name in the language or script of the [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper) as [Name of publisher](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-publisher/). If this criterion does not apply, transcribe the name that appears first as [Name of publisher](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-publisher/).

<a name="5.225.3.4">5.225.3.4</a> Transcribe remaining publisher names appearing on the same source as the [Name of publisher](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-publisher/) as Parallel names of publisher. If a parallel name of publisher is from a different source than the [Name of publisher](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-publisher/), make a [Note on publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement) if considered important (see [5.24.35.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#5.24.35.1)).

<a name="5.225.3.5">5.225.3.5</a> *Optionally*, if the parallel publishers' names are considered too numerous to list exhaustively and some may be omitted without significant loss of identification, all after the third may be omitted. Supply in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the nature of the omitted information. Include the number of omitted names in the supplied phrase. Do not use the mark of omission.
