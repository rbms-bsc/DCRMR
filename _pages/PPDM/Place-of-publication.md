## 5.21.325 Supplied larger jurisdictions

<a name="5.21.325.1">5.21.325.1</a> Supply in square brackets the name of the country, state, province, etc., after the name of the place if it is considered necessary for identification, or if it is considered necessary to distinguish the place from others of the same name.

>**Example:**

Do not use the mark of omission.

<a name="5.21.33.4">5.21.33.4</a> Do not, however, transcribe a subsequent place as a Place of publication if it must be transcribed as a grammatically inseparable part of another element.

>**Example:**  
>Place of publication: <CITE>London</CITE>  
>Name of publisher: <CITE>Printed and published by J. P. Coghlan, and sold by J. Wilkie, and C. Elliot, Edinburgh</CITE>  

<a name="5.21.33.5">5.21.33.5</a> If a place of publication associated with an earlier manifestation appears together with the actual place of publication of the manifestation being described, transcribe the places as a single element in the order in which they appear.

>**Example:**  
><CITE>London printed and Dublin re-printed</CITE>  
>>(*Source of information reads*: London printed and Dublin re-printed by Thomas Stewart, military stationer, no. 1, King's Inns Quay, M.DCC.XCIII)  
>>(*Comment*: The manufacturer is assumed to be also functioning as the publisher; the place given in the source is treated as the place of publication; see [5.2.335.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Publication-statement/#5.2.335.1))

<a name="5.21.33.6">5.21.33.6</a> If both the place and [Name of publisher](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-publisher/) associated with an earlier manifestation appear together with the place and [Name of publisher](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-publisher/) of the manifestation being described, transcribe each place with the publisher to which it corresponds.

>**Example:**  
>Publication statement: <CITE>London : Printed and sold by H. Fry, Finsbury-Place ; New-York : Re-published by William Cobbett, no. 141, Hanover-Square, 1800</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Example formatted with ISBD punctuation for clarity)

## 5.21.34 Places of publication in multiple unit resources

<a name="5.21.34.1">5.21.34.1</a> If the manifestation is issued in more than one physical part and the place of publication changes in the course of publication, transcribe as Place of publication the place named in the first or earliest part and always record the place named in the later part(s) in a [Note on publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/) (see [5.24.32.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#5.24.32.1)).
