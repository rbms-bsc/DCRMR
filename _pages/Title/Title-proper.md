## 1.1A5 Words considered part of the title proper

<a name="1.1A5.1">1.1A5.1</a> Title information preceding the chief title on the title page is considered part of the title proper if it is grammatically inseparable from the chief title. If the chief title is preceded or followed in the source by other elements of information, transpose these elements to their appropriate elements in the description (or give them in a note) unless case endings would be affected, the grammatical construction of the information would be disturbed, or the text is otherwise grammatically inseparable from the title proper. In the latter cases, transcribe the information as part of the title proper.
