## 1.21.1 Element information

<a name="1.21.1.1">1.21.1.1</a> [Link to RDA Toolkit](https://access.rdatoolkit.org/Content/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-4b9291c5-f525-37fd-b661-c469e763ce8a){:target="_blank"}

<a name="1.21.1.2">1.21.1.2</a> [Sources of information](/DCRMR/title/#1011-sources-of-information)

## 1.21.2 RDA definition and scope

<a name="1.21.2.1">1.21.2.1</a> A nomen that is a title of manifestation that is selected for preference in a specific application or context.

<a name="1.21.2.2">1.21.2.2</a> An alternative title is treated as part of a title proper.

## 1.21.31 Words considered part of the title proper

<a name="1.21.31.1">1.21.31.1</a> The title proper is the first element of the description. Title information preceding the [chief title](/DCRMR/glossary/C/#chief-title) on the preferred source of information is considered part of the title proper if it is grammatically inseparable from the chief title. If the chief title is preceded or followed in the source by other elements of information, transpose these elements to their appropriate elements in the description unless case endings would be affected, the grammatical construction of the information would be disturbed, or the text is otherwise grammatically inseparable from the title proper. In the latter cases, transcribe the information as part of the title proper.

>Example:  
><CITE>Monsieur Bossu's treatise of the epicke poem</CITE>  

>Example:  
><CITE>M. Tullii Ciceronis de officiis libri tres</CITE>    
 
>Example:  
><CITE>Walt Disney presents Sleeping Beauty</CITE>  

For transposed elements, provide additional title access for the Title proper if considered important (see [Variant title of manifestation, 1.25.357.1](/DCRMR/title/Variant-title-of-manifestation/#1.25.357.1)).

<a name="1.21.31.2">1.21.31.2</a> **Note on the source of the title proper**. Always make a note on the source of the Title proper if it is from a title page substitute (see [Data provenance, 0.1.34.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Data-provenance/#0.1.34.1) and [Note on title, 1.29.31.1](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/#1.29.31.1)).

>Example:  
>Title proper: <CITE>A new list of fifty two ships sent to the East-Indies</CITE>  
>Note on title: <CITE>Title from docket title</CITE>  

## 1.21.32 Forms of the title proper

<a name="1.21.32.1">1.21.32.1</a> The title proper can take a variety of forms, some of which are exemplified below:

<a name="1.21.32.2">1.21.32.2</a> Title proper inclusive of grammatically inseparable title information appearing before the chief title on the title page.

>Example:  
><CITE>Here after foloweth a litel boke called Colyn Cloute</CITE>  
>(*Comment*: “Colyn Cloute” is the chief title)

<a name="1.21.32.3">1.21.32.3</a> Title proper inclusive of an alternative title (a subsequent title joined with a conjunction such as “or”).

>Example:  
><CITE>The British carpenter, or, A treatise on carpentry</CITE>  

<a name="1.21.32.4">1.21.32.4</a> Title proper consisting solely of the name of a responsible person or body.  

>Example:  
><CITE>C. Sallustius Crispus</CITE>  

## 1.21.33 Title proper with grammatically inseparable designation

<a name="1.21.33.1">1.21.33.1</a> If a manifestation is in more than one volume and the title proper of each volume includes a grammatically inseparable designation such as numbering that is specific to that volume, supply in square brackets after the first designation a hyphen and the final designation, omitting intermediate designations. Do the same for single-volume manifestations that contain multiple parts. 

>Example:  
><CITE>Thomas Masterson his first[-second] booke of arithmeticke</CITE>  
>(*Sources of information read*:  
>Thomas Masterson his first booke of arithmeticke;  
>Thomas Masterson his second booke of arithmeticke)

>Example:  
><CITE>Le premier-[quart] volume de l'histoire et cronique de messire Iehan Froissart</CITE>  
>(*Sources of information read*:  
>Le premier volume de l'histoire et cronique de messire Iehan Froissart  
>Le second volume de l'histoire et cronique de messire Iehan Froissart  
>Le tiers volume de l'histoire et cronique de messire Iehan Froissart  
>Le quart volume de l'histoire et cronique de messire Iehan Froissart)  

If it is not feasible to do this, transcribe the title proper of the first volume or part without this interpolation and make a [Note on title](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/) about the later designation(s) (see [1.29.32.1](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/#1.29.32.1)).

## 1.21.34 No title

<a name="1.21.34.1">1.21.34.1</a> If no title can be found within the resource, supply a title from one of the sources listed at [0.1.7.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Data-provenance/#0.1.7.1). If no title can be found in any source, use as the title proper the opening words of the text if these provide a reasonably distinctive title. If the opening words of the text are not suitable, or if the beginning of the text is lacking, devise a brief descriptive title, preferably in the language and script of the cataloging agency, and use this supplied or devised title, enclosed in square brackets, as the Title proper. Always make a [Note on title](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/) indicating the source of the Title proper (see [1.29.33.1](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/#1.29.33.1)).

>Example:  
>Title proper: <CITE>Ye true-born Englishmen proceed, our trifling crimes detect</CITE>  
>Note on title: <CITE>Title from opening two lines of poem</CITE>

>Example:  
>Title proper: <CITE>[Observations on a bill relative to the militia]</CITE>  
>Note on title: <CITE>Title devised by cataloger from content</CITE>  
>(*Comment*: Opening words “Herewith and the desire of being serviceable in the smallest degree to my country ...” not suitable as title)

>Example:  
>Title proper: <CITE>[Sermaõ de Santa Isabel Rainha de Portugal]</CITE>  
>Note on title: <CITE>Title from Barbosa Machado.</CITE>  
>(*Comment*: A full citation to Barbosa Machado is given in a [Manifestation described in note](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Manifestation-described-in/) (see [9.32.31.1](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Manifestation-described-in/#9.32.31.1))

## 1.21.35 Title proper with supplementary or section designation or title

<a name="1.21.35.1">1.21.35.1</a> If a manifestation bears a title proper that includes the title of an expression that is supplementary to, or a section of, another expression and appears in two or more grammatically separable parts, transcribe the title that is common to all parts or sections first, followed by the designation(s) and/or title(s) of the supplement(s) or section(s) in order of their dependence.  Always make a [Note on title](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/) indicating the original position on the preferred source of information of any transpositions (see [1.29.34.1](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/#1.29.34.1)).

>Example:  
>Title proper: <CITE>Faust. Part one.</CITE>  
>Note on title: <CITE> Title page reads: Part one. Faust.</CITE>

If describing an individual issue of a serial, transcribe the numbering of the issue as instructed in [Appendix H](/DCRMR/appendices/Appendix-h/). (Note: Appendix H will be incorporated in a future iteration. Catalogers should continue to consult Appendix H of DCRM(B) for the time being.)

## 1.21.36 Abridgments of the title proper

<a name="1.21.36.1">1.21.36.1</a> **General rule**. *Optionally*, if the title proper is very lengthy and can be abridged without loss of essential information, omit less important words or phrases, using the mark of omission. Do not omit any of the first five words (or, if the Title proper begins with an article, the first six words).

<a name="1.21.36.2">1.21.36.2</a> **Alternative title**. If the title proper contains an alternative title, do not omit any of the first five words of the alternative title (or, if the alternative title begins with an article, the first six words).

<a name="1.21.36.3">1.21.36.3</a> Extend the transcription of the title proper through at least the end of the [chief title](/DCRMR/glossary/C/#chief-title) of the resource. Apply this provision even if other words in the title proper precede the chief title. If the end of the chief title cannot be determined, break off the transcription at the first grammatically acceptable place, but never within the first five words of the chief title (or, if the chief title begins with an article, the first six words).

## 1.21.37 Manifestations without a collective title 

### 1.21.371 Two or more expressions named on the preferred source of information

<a name="1.21.371.1">1.21.371.1</a> If a manifestation has no collective title and the preferred source of information bears the titles of two or more individual expressions, other than supplementary matter (see [1.21.35](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/#12135-title-proper-with-supplementary-or-section-designation-or-title)), that are contained in the manifestation, transcribe the titles of the individual expressions in the order in which they appear on the preferred source of information. See [Element order (1.01.2.5)](/DCRMR/title/#1.01.2.5) for guidance on recording. If using ISBD punctuation, see [Prescribed punctuation (0.2.1.2)](/DCRMR/general-rules/Prescribed-punctuation/#0.2.1.2) for guidance.

>Example:  
><CITE>Laurentij Vallae elegantiarum Latinae linguae libri sex ; eiusdem De
reciprocatione sui & suus libellus</CITE>  
>(*Comment*: Example formatted with ISBD punctuation for clarity)

>Example:  
><CITE>The serving-man become a queen. Jockey of the green. The lass of Richmond Hill</CITE>

### 1.21.372 One or more expressions not named on the preferred source of information

<a name="1.21.372.1">1.21.372.1</a> If the manifestation has no collective title, and one or more expressions contained in the manifestation are not named on the preferred source of information, either: 

a) Transcribe the title and [Statement of responsibility relating to title proper](/DCRMR/sor/Statement-of-responsibility-relating-to-title-proper/) from the preferred source of information, and name the other expressions(s) in a contents note (see [Note on manifestation, 9.3.32](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-manifestation/#9332-contents-notes)) 

b) Make a separate description for each separately titled expression, linking the separate descriptions with “With” notes (see [Issued with, 9.34.3.1](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Issued-with/#9.34.3.1))  

c) Supply a collective title from one of the sources listed at [0.1.7.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Data-provenance/#0.1.7.1).

d) Devise a collective title for the whole manifestation, preferably in the language and script of the cataloging agency, and use this devised title, enclosed in square brackets, as the Title proper

>Example:  
><CITE>[Acts of Parliament enacted in 1732]</CITE>

>Example:  
>Title proper: <CITE>Isidora</CITE>  
>Note on manifestation: <CITE>Volume 3 also includes the author’s Fanchette (p. [87]-232) and Lettre d’un paysan de la Vallée-Noir (p. [233]-307)</CITE>  

## 1.21.38 Single-sheet manifestations

### 1.21.381 General rule

<a name="1.21.381.1">1.21.381.1</a> In general, transcribe the information presented beginning with the first line of printing. If the printing is arranged in columns with no information preceding the body of the text, begin the transcription with the top line of the extreme left column (extreme right column in the case of languages that are read right to left). Retain in the transcription dates, addresses, and other information necessary for identification. Use judgment, but in case of doubt, start the transcription with the first words of printed text on the sheet. If the initial text is grammatically independent of the succeeding material and is one of the following, however, begin the transcription after it without using the mark of omission:
+ caption to an illustration
+ copyright statement
+ device
+ edition statement
+ production, publication, distribution, manufacture statement
+ motto
+ official numbering
+ page number
+ part of an illustration or ornament
+ price
+ tabular material

If the initial text has been omitted, indicate the nature and position of the omitted material in a [Note on title](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/) if considered important (see [1.29.35.1](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/#1.29.35.1)).

### 1.21.382 Title proper of a single-sheet manifestation

<a name="1.21.382.1">1.21.382.1</a> If there is a word or phrase obviously intended as the [Title of manifestation](/DCRMR/title/Title-of-manifestation/) that is not the first line of printing, transcribe it as the entire title proper, omitting information appearing before it on the page without the mark of omission. In general, apply this instruction only when such a title is not integrated grammatically with the rest of the text, is set off typographically, and has as its sole function the naming of the resource as a whole. When such a title is selected, also give in a [Note on title](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/) at least the first five words of the first line of printing (see [1.29.35.2](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/#1.29.35.2)). In case of doubt as to the selection of the title proper, start the transcription with the first line as described above.

<a name="1.21.382.2">1.21.382.2</a> If there is no word or phrase obviously intended as a title, transcribe the text as found through at least a relatively distinctive word or phrase. If the distinctive word or phrase is not near the beginning of the transcription, less important words or phrases preceding it may be omitted, using the mark of omission. Do not, however, abridge the transcription before the sixth word. If the text is very lengthy, end the transcription at the first grammatically acceptable place after a distinctive word or phrase; the omitted material may be summarized in a [Note on title](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/) if considered important (see [1.29.35.3](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/#1.29.35.3)).

### 1.21.383 Two or more expressions with a collective title on a single sheet

<a name="1.21.383.1">1.21.383.1</a> If a resource printed on a single sheet contains two or more expressions and has a collective title, transcribe only the collective title as the title proper. Make a formal or informal contents note for the expressions (see [Note on manifestation, 9.3.32](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-manifestation/#9332-contents-notes)).

### 1.21.384 Two or more expressions without a collective title on a single sheet

<a name="1.21.384.1">1.21.384.1</a> If a resource printed on a single sheet contains two or more expressions but does not have a collective title, transcribe as the title proper the first title or opening words of the text. Make a formal or informal contents note and include in it the titles of the additional works (see [Note on manifestation, 9.3.32](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-manifestation/#9332-contents-notes)). 

<a name="1.21.384.2">1.21.384.2</a> If the sheet is printed on both sides and it is impossible to determine which side should be read first, make a separate metadata description for each side of the sheet, and include a formal “With, on other side” note in each record (see [Issued with, 9.34.3.1](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Issued-with/#9.34.3.1)).

### 1.21.385 Two or more expressions or manifestations with separate publication, distribution, or manufacture statements on a single sheet

<a name="1.21.385.1">1.21.385.1</a> If there are two or more manifestations printed on a single sheet and each has its own publication, distribution, or manufacture statement, or there is other conclusive evidence that they were intended to be separately issued, make a separate description for each manifestation that was intended to be issued separately. Include a formal “With” note in each record indicating that the manifestations were printed on a single sheet and that they were “intended to be separated” (see [Issued with, 9.34.3.1](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Issued-with/#9.34.3.1)). If there are two or more manifestations printed on a single sheet giving the appearance that they were possibly intended to be separated, but there is no conclusive evidence that this is the case, follow the provisions of [1.21.384.1](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/#1.21.384.1), and always make a [Note on manifestation](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-manifestation/) indicating that they were “possibly intended to be separated” (see [9.3.3.1](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-manifestation/#9.3.3.1)).
