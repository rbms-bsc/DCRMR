## 8.27.1 Element information

<a name="8.27.1.1">8.27.1.1</a> [Link to RDA Toolkit](https://access.rdatoolkit.org/en-US_ala-04e52191-96ac-3870-ac6a-de37540f45f5){:target="_blank"}

<a name="8.27.1.2">8.27.1.2</a> [Sources of information](/DCRMR/series/#8011-sources-of-information)

## 8.27.2 RDA definition and scope

<a name="8.27.2.1">8.27.2.1</a> A nomen that is a designation that is assigned to a manifestation to identify its position in a sequence of individual parts of a larger manifestation or parts or issues of a larger work.

<a name="8.27.2.2">8.27.2.2</a> Numbering may include dates or other timespans, alphanumeric or other characters, and an accompanying caption.

## 8.27.3 General rule

<a name="8.27.3.1">8.27.3.1</a> Transcribe series numbering as it appears in the manifestation as the last element in the [Series statement](/DCRMR/series/Series-statement/). If the numbering does not appear after the other series elements  in the source, transpose it as needed. Always provide details of the transposition in a [Note on series statement](/DCRMR/series/Note-on-series-statement/) (see [8.29.3.2](/DCRMR/series/Note-on-series-statement/#8.29.3.2)). However, if the numbering is grammatically inseparable from the series title, transcribe it as part of [Title of series](/DCRMR/series/Title-of-series/) (see [8.21.3.3](/DCRMR/series/Title-of-series/#8.21.3.3)).

<a name="8.27.3.2">8.27.3.2</a> Transcribe the numbering as it appears in the manifestation (see [Transcription, 0.4.3](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#043-punctuation)). Do not use abbreviations not present in the source and do not convert roman or spelled-out numerals to arabic.

>**Example:**  
>Title of series: <CITE>Serie lecturas de economía colimense</CITE>  
>Numbering within sequence: <CITE>núm. II</CITE>  

>**Example:**  
>Title of series: <CITE>Collection of British authors</CITE>  
>Numbering within sequence: <CITE>vol. LXII</CITE>  

>**Example:**  
>Title of series: <CITE>The adventure series</CITE>  
>Numbering within sequence: <CITE>7</CITE>   

>**Example:**  
>Title of series: <CITE>The “boys’ first-rate pocket library” of complete tales</CITE>  
>Numbering within sequence: <CITE>no. 60</CITE>   
      
>**Example:**  
>Title of series: <CITE>Oeuvres philosophiques de Mr. D. Hume</CITE>  
>Numbering within sequence: <CITE>tome troisième</CITE> 

<a name="8.27.3.3">8.27.3.3</a> If there is series numbering but no series title, always transcribe the numbering in a [Note on series statement](/DCRMR/series/Note-on-series-statement/) (see [8.29.3.4](/DCRMR/series/Note-on-series-statement/#8.29.3.4)). 

>**Example:**  
>Note on series statement: <CITE>Number “6” appears at head of title page; issued as part of the American tract series (see Bibliography of American literature)</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Making a note on the number is required; providing the additional information from the Bibliography of American literature is optional. The formal citation for the Bibliography of American literature is given in a [Manifestation described by](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Manifestation-described-by/) note (see [9.32.31.2](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Manifestation-described-by/#9.32.31.2)))

In case of doubt as to whether a number appearing in the resource is series numbering, transcribe the numbering in a [Note on identifier for manifestation](/DCRMR/identifiers/Note-on-identifier-for-manifestation/) (see [10.23.3.1](/DCRMR/identifiers/Note-on-identifier-for-manifestation/#10.23.3.1)).

<a name="8.27.3.4">8.27.3.4</a> If a phrase such as “new series,” “second series,” etc., appears with a numbered series, transcribe the phrase as part of Numbering within sequence (see [Title of series, 8.21.32.2](/DCRMR/series/Title-of-series/#8.21.32.2)).

>**Example:**  
>Title of series: <CITE>Killaly chapbooks</CITE>  
>Numbering within sequence: <CITE>2nd series, no. 6</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Series is numbered; phrase “2nd series” transcribed as part of the Numbering within sequence element)

## 8.27.32 Numbering relating to parallel title of series

<a name="8.27.32.1">8.27.32.1</a> If there is one or more [Parallel title of series](/DCRMR/series/Parallel-title-of-series/) and the series numbering also appears in more than one language or script, transcribe each number after the [Title of series](/DCRMR/series/Title-of-series/) to which it relates (following any other title information or any statement of responsibility associated with the title).

>**Example:**  
>Series statement: <CITE>Nachschlagewerke und Quellen zur Kunst ; Teil 6 = Art reference works and sources ; part 6</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Information is transcribed in three elements: [Title of series](/DCRMR/series/Title-of-series/); [Parallel title of series](/DCRMR/series/Parallel-title-of-series/); and Numbering within sequence. The example is formatted with ISBD punctuation for clarity)
 
>**Example:**  
>Series statement: <CITE>Annalen. Reeks in-8o. Menselijke wetenschappen ; nr. 111 = Annales. Série in-8o. Sciences humaines ; no. 111</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Information is transcribed in three elements: [Title of series](/DCRMR/series/Title-of-series/); [Parallel title of series](/DCRMR/series/Parallel-title-of-series/); and Numbering within sequence. The example is formatted with ISBD punctuation for clarity)
  
>**Example:**  
>Series statement: <CITE>O.B.E.M.A ; no. 12 = O.B.E.M.A. ; nr. 12</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Information is transcribed in three elements: [Title of series](/DCRMR/series/Title-of-series/); [Parallel title of series](/DCRMR/series/Parallel-title-of-series/) and Numbering within sequence. The example is formatted formatted with ISBD punctuation for clarity)   

<a name="8.27.32.2">8.27.32.2</a> If the series numbering appears only once, transcribe it after the [Title of series](/DCRMR/series/Title-of-series/) to which it relates. However, if the numbering relates to all, more than one, or none of the titles of series, transcribe it at the end of the [Series statement](/DCRMR/series/Series-statement/).

>**Example:**  
>Series statement: <CITE>Série bilingue = Bilingual series ; 5</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Information is transcribed in three elements: [Title of series](/DCRMR/series/Title-of-series/); [Parallel title of series](/DCRMR/series/Parallel-title-of-series/) and Numbering within sequence. The example is formatted formatted with ISBD punctuation for clarity)

<a name="8.27.32.3">8.27.32.3</a> If any parallel titles of series have been omitted from the transcription, also omit their associated numberings.
