# 0.5 Transcription

<a name="0.5">0.5</a> *Optionally,* record a transcription standard used for the metadata work as a [related manifestation of work](https://beta.rdatoolkit.org/Content/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-123e0456-8c5f-3236-ba8a-155b8294a32c "RDA element: related manifestation of work"). _**ALT note: this is directly from the RDA Tookit [instructions on Transcription](https://beta.rdatoolkit.org/en-US_ala-cfa18e03-17f2-378a-874c-86515bf7e0ac/div_cfw_wqc_ydb); since it's a relationship element, do we want to punt it right now?**_

## 0.5.0 General guidelines on transcription

<a name="0.5.0">0.5.0</a> Transcribe information in the form and order in which it is presented in the resource, according to these general rules, unless instructed otherwise by specific rules. Do not use the mark of omission to indicate transposition.

DCRMR normalizes puncutation and capitalization based on current conventions, with an optional exception in punctuation (see [0.5.3.1.2](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.3.1.2)). 

If nonnormalized transcription is considered important, follow [RDA Guidelines on basic transcription](https://beta.rdatoolkit.org/Guidance/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-fd2213e6-ae72-3e6f-8f0a-be3fc0e8d728 "RDA Guidelines on basic transcription") and consistently apply it throughout the resource description.

## 0.5.1 Letters, diacritical marks, ligatures, symbols, and rebuses

### 0.5.1.1 Letters and diacritical marks

In general, transcribe letters and diaritical as they appear. Do not add accent sand other diacritical marks not present in the manifestation. Convert earlier forms of letters and diacritical marks to their modern form (TBD BELOW).

*Optionally*, when converting uppercase to lowercase, add diacritical marks that are not present on the source of information in accordance with the pattern of usage in the text.

### 0.5.1.2 Ligatures

In most languages, including Latin, transcribe a ligature by giving its component letters separately. Do not, however, separate the component letters of æ in Anglo-Saxon; œ in French; or æ and œ in ancient or modern Scandinavian languages. 

### 0.5.1.3 Symbols, etc.

<a name="0.5.1.3.1">0.5.1.3.1</a> Replace symbols or other matter that cannot be reproduced using available typographical facilities with a cataloger's description in square brackets. Make a note if necessary.

For additional guidance on recording signs and symbols, see the LC-PCC PS for 1.7.5. **ALT note: do we keep the reference to the LC-PCC PS?**

>Example:  
><CITE>A.J. Garnerin, aeoronaute, inv. du parachute, né à Paris 1769, [death symbol] 1813</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads*: A.J. GARNERIN, AERONAUTE, Inv. du Parachute, Né à Paris 1769 &#8224; 1813)

<a name="0.5.1.3.2">0.5.1.3.2</a> **ALT note: We kept this alternative in the RBMS PS, based on pre-3R RDA instructions. However, this alternative does not seem to be present in post-3R RDA (at least not under "Guidelines / Normalized transcription / symbols") -- do we want to strike it? The text of the instruction is currently verbatim from pre-3R RDA; there's not a DCRM equivalent so far as I know.** *Alternative rule*. If transcribing a symbol reproducible by the facilities available significantly hinders clarity, omit the symbol or replace it by another symbol or sign of punctuation, as necessary.

[RDA]
A history of French-speaking countries
Title appears on the source of information as: A history of French=speaking countries

Make a note to indicate that the symbol has been omitted or replaced by another symbol or sign of punctuation (see 2.17), if considered important for identification.

Ignore typographical devices that are used as separators, etc.

**ALT note: end of pre-3R RDA text**

### 0.5.1.4 Early letterforms and symbols

Convert earlier forms of letters and symbols to their modern forms.

Brevigraphs

If brevigraphs (special marks of contraction in continuance of the manuscript tradition) have been used, expand affected words to their full form and enclose supplied letters in square brackets. The values of many contractions are dependent on context, with the most common values provided here.

![Brevigraphs, chart 3](https://rbms-bsc.github.io/DCRMR/assets/pictures/transcription/early contractions 03.png "brevigraphs, chart 3")

Make an explanatory note if necessary.

If a brevigraph standing for an entire word appears in the source, supply instead the word itself, enclosed in square brackets. Enclose each expansion or supplied word in its own set of square brackets.

>Example:  
><CITE>Sould by Will. Faithorne att [the] sign of [the] Shipp within Temple Bar</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads*:  Sould by Will. Faithorne att ![ye](https://rbms-bsc.github.io/DCRMR/assets/pictures/transcription/ye.png "ye") sign of ![ye](https://rbms-bsc.github.io/DCRMR/assets/pictures/transcription/ye.png "ye") shipp within Temple Bar)

If the meaning of a brevigraph is conjectural or unknown, apply the bracketing conventions given in [conjectural and indecipherable text (0.5.6.2) ](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.6.2 "conjectural and indecipherable text").

### 0.5.1.4 Rebuses

<a name="0.5.1.4">0.5.1.4</a> Replace pictures in rebuses with the intended words in square brackets.

Make an explanatory note.

>Example:  
>Title proper: <CITE>The [Bute] interest in the [city], or, The [bridge] in the [hole]</CITE>  
>Note on title: <CITE>Title in the form of a rebus. Bute represented as a boot in the rebus.</CITE>

### 0.5.1.5 [Key designations] 

Transcribe accidentals (flat and sharp signs, etc.) directly following the key letters being modified. Do not insert a space. 

>Example:  
><CITE>A&#9837; major</CITE>

If minor keys are represented by lowercase letters in the chief source, transcribe them as lowercase. Otherwise, record any letter(s) representing the key in uppercase.

## 0.5.2 Capitalization and conversion of case

### 0.5.2.1 General rule

<a name="0.5.2.1">0.5.2.1</a> Convert letters to uppercase or lowercase according to the guidelines for [Capitalization](https://beta.rdatoolkit.org/Resource/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-f32d79b7-2177-300c-ae09-639ac89b5d49 "RDA: Capitalization") in the RDA Toolkit, with the following exceptions. 

For guidelines converting I or V to lowercase, or i, j, u, or v to uppercase, see [0.5.2.2 Letterforms I, V, i, j, u, and V](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.2.3).

### 0.5.2.2 Roman numerals

<a name="0.5.2.2">0.5.2.2</a> Do not convert case when transcribing roman numerals.

### 0.5.2.3 Letterforms I, V, i, j, u, and v

If the rules for capitalization require converting I or V to lowercase, or i, j, u, or v to uppercase, follow the pattern of usage in the text to determine which letterform to use in the transcription. 

Establish the pattern of usage by examining text in the same typeface (i.e., roman, italic, or gothic) in the publication being described. Look for letters expressed in the opposite case from the letterforms to be converted, but having the same function (vowel or consonant) and same relative position (appearing in initial, medial, or final positions) as the letterforms to be converted. Begin by examining the remainder of the title page and then, if necessary, proceed to examine the body of the text in other parts of the resource in the same typeface. 

>Example:  
>Title proper: <CITE>Les oeuures morales de Plutarque</CITE>  
>Statement of responsibility: <CITE>translatees de grec en françois, reueues et corrigees en plusieurs passages par le translateur</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads*: LES OEVVRES MORALES DE PLVTARQVE, TRANSLATEES DE GREC EN FRANÇOIS, REVEVES ET corrigees en plusieurs passages par le translateur)  
>(*Comment*: In the publication, the body of the text in roman type shows consistent use of v for vowels or consonants in initial position and u for vowels or consonants elsewhere, e.g., "ville," "vn," "conuersation," "tout," and "entendu")

If the pattern of usage cannot be determined within a reasonable amount of time, use this conversion table as a solution of last resort.

Converting uppercase letterforms:

| Uppercase letterform to be converted | Lowercase conversion |
| --- | ---| --- |
| I (vowel or consonant) anywhere in word | i | 
| II at end of word | ij | 
| II elsewhere in word | ii |
| V (vowel or consonant) at beginning of word | v |
| V (vowel or consonant) elsewhere in word	| u |

Converting lowercase letterforms:

| Lowercase letterform to be converted | Uppercase conversion |
| --- | ---| --- |
| i (vowel or consonant) anywhere in word | I | 
| j (vowel or consonant) anywhere in word | I | 
| u (vowel or consonant) anywhere in word | V |
| v (vowel or consonant) anywhere in word | V |

If any letterform within the first five words of the title has been converted from I to j, from j to I, from V to u, or from u to V (the first six words if the title begins with an article), record a [Variant title 1.6](/DCRMR/title/Variant-title "Variant title") using alternative forms of the title proper as needed.

If the manifestation uses a gothic typeface that does not distinguish between the letters i/j or the letters u/v, transcribe the letters as i and v respectively.


### 0.5.2.4 Final capital "I" in Latin

<a name="0.5.2.4">0.5.2.4</a> Do not convert to lowercase a final capital I in Latin texts when the final I is uppercase and the immediately preceding letters in the word are lowercase or smaller capital letters. Since this usage is not merely typographic but affects meaning, the capital must be left in that form.

>Example:  
><CITE>M. AccI Plauti quae supersunt Comoediae</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads:* M. AccI Plauti quae supersunt Comoediae)

>Example:  
><CITE>ValerI Andreae DesselI I.C. Bibliotheca Belgica</CITE>

If the letter occurs within the first five words of the title proper (the first six words if the title begins with an article), record a variant title for the form of title with the final capital I converted to ii (see [Variant title 1.6](/DCRMR/title/Variant-title "Variant title")).


### 0.5.2.5 Chronograms

<a name="0.5.2.5">0.5.2.5</a> Capital letters occurring apparently at random or in a particular sequence may represent a chronogram. Where there is good reason to assume that a chronogram is being used, do not convert letters considered part of the chronogram from uppercase to lowercase, or from lowercase to uppercase.

>Example:  
><CITE>Ipso anno tertIo saeCVLarI typographIae DIVIno aVXILIo a gerManIs InVentae</CITE>

For guidance on recording the chronogram as a date element, see the instructions for specific types of dates as follows:
* **ALT note: TBD For date of production, see X.X.X.X**
* For [date of publication](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-publication/ "date of publication"), see [4.205.4.2](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-publication/#4.205.4.2 "4.205.4.2")
* For [date of distribution](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-distribution/ "date of distribution"), see [4.215.4.2](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-distribution/#4.215.4.2 "date of distribution")
* For [date of manufacture](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-manufacture/ "date of manufacture"), see [4.225.5.2](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-manufacture/#4.225.5.2 "date of manufacture")


## 0.5.3 Punctuation

### 0.5.3.1 General rule

<a name="0.5.3.1">0.5.3.1</a> Use modern punctuation conventions instead of transcribing punctuation as it appears on the source. 

>Example:  
><CITE>Perdito & Perdita, or, The man & woman of the people</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads:* Perdito & Perdita—or—the Man & Woman of the People)

>Example:  
><CITE>A musical entertainment perform’d on November XXII, 1683</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads:* A musical entertainment perform’d on November XXII. 1683)

>Example:  
><CITE>London : Printed for A. Millar, over-against Catharine-Street in the Strand, M,DCC,LI [1751]</CITE>  
>(*Source of Information reads*: London: Printed for A. Millar, over-against Catharine-street in the Strand. M,DCC,LI.)

Omit or add punctuation as needed for clarity.

>Example:  
><CITE>Libres, libertad de cultos, libertad de palabra, libres de miseria, libres de temor</CITE>  
>(*Comment:* Commas added to represent breaks indicated by poster’s lettering style and word placement.)

<a name="0.5.3.1.1">0.5.3.1.1</a> **Punctuation integral to words and compounds words**. Generally transcribe integral punctuation as it appears on the source (e.g., printers’ or night-club). Do not add or omit punctuation integral to the spelling of words and compound words. Apply the following subinstructions, as appropriate:
* Apostrophes (see [0.5.3.2](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.3.2 "Apostrophes"))
* Hyphens (see [0.5.3.3](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.3.3 "Hyphens"))
* Punctuation indicating an abbreviation (see [0.5.3.10](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.3.10 "Punctuation indicating an abbreviation"))
* Punctuation substituting for letters (see [0.5.3.9](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.2.9 "Punctuation substituting for letters"))
* Punctuation within Roman numerals (see [0.5.3.4](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.3.4 "Punctuation within Roman numerals"))

<a name="0.5.3.1.2">0.5.3.1.2</a> **Nonnormalized transcription**. *Optionally*, transcribe all punctuation as it appears on the source, with the exception of those marks covered in the following subinstructions:
* Ellipses (see [0.5.3.5](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.3.5 "Ellipses")
* Square brackets (see [0.5.3.6](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.3.6 "square brackets"))
* Virgules (see [0.5.3.7](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.3.7 "virgules"))
* Line endings (see [0.5.3.8](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.3.8 "Line endings"))

>Example:  
><CITE>Perdito & Perdita—or—the Man & Woman of the People</CITE>

If a library applies ISBD punctuation and the option for nonnormalized transcription is applied, then record both transcribed punctuation and prescribed punctuation, even if this results in double punctuation. (See also [Prescribed punctuation](/DCRMR/general-rules/Prescribed-punctuation "prescribed punctuation").)

>Example:  
><CITE>London: : Printed for A. Millar, over-against Catharine-street in the Strand., M,DCC,LI. [1751]</CITE>

### 0.5.3.2 Apostrophes

<a name="0.5.3.2">0.5.3.2</a> Transcribe apostrophes as found. 

>Example:  
><CITE>Uncle Wiggly's story book</CITE>

Do not supply apostrophes not present in the source.

>Example:  
><CITE>Scotlands speech to her sons</CITE>

### 0.5.3.3 Hyphens

<a name="0.5.3.3">0.5.3.3</a> Transcribe hyphens used to connect the constituent parts of compound words, normalizing their form as necessary. 

>Example:  
><CITE>A catalogue of the library of Yale-College in New-Haven</CITE>

>Example:  
><CITE>A night-club map of Harlem</CITE>

Do not supply hyphens not present in the source.

>Example:  
><CITE>Report of the Boston Female Anti Slavery Society</CITE>

>Example:  
><CITE>Black and white photographs in Jury Assembly Room, first floor of U.S. Courthouse, Orlando, Florida</CITE>

For hyphens or other marks of punctuation used to connect a single word divided between two lines, see the instruction [line endings (0.5.3.8)](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.3.8 "line endings").

### 0.5.3.4 Punctuation within Roman numerals

<a name="0.5.3.4">0.5.3.4</a> Retain internal marks of punctuation appearing within roman numerals.

>Example:  
><CITE>M.DCC.LXXXIV</CITE>

### 0.5.3.5 Ellipses

<a name="0.5.3.5">0.5.3.5</a> Omit ellipses when present in the source; replace with a dash (- -). **ALT note: we'd omitted the instruction to replace with a dash in the RBMS PS**

>Example:  
>Title proper: <CITE>America, America, God shed his grace on thee and crown thy good with brotherhood</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads*: ... America, America, God shed his grace on thee and crown thy good with brotherhood...)

<a name="0.5.3.5.1">0.5.3.5.1</a> **Alternative rule**. Ellipses present in the source may be retained if considered important for meaning, clarity, or identification. If retained, make an explanatory note. 

>Example:  
>Title proper: <CITE>...it felt like i knew you...</CITE>  
>Note on title: <CITE>Ellipses in title appear on the source.</CITE>

### 0.5.3.6 Square brackets

<a name="0.5.3.6.1">0.5.3.6.1</a> Replace square brackets with parentheses when present in the source. Make an explanatory note, if considered important for identification.

>Example:  
>Title proper: <CITE>A treatise wherein this case (how to discerne Gods answers to our prayers) is briefly resolved.</CITE>  
>Note on title: <CITE>The words "how to discerne Gods answers to our prayers" on the title page are in square brackets.</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads*: A treatise wherein this case [how to discerne Gods answers to our prayers] is briefly resolved.)

<a name="0.5.3.6.2">0.5.3.6.2</a> *Alternative rule*. Omit the square brackets. Make an explanatory note, if considered important for identification.

>Date of publication: <CITE>MDCCLXXV</CITE>  
>Note on publication statement: <CITE>On title page, the date of publication is enclosed by square brackets.</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads*: [MDCCLXXV])

<a name="0.5.3.6.3">0.5.3.6.3</a> *Alternative rule*. Square brackets present in the source may be retained if they indicate interpolation and are important for meaning and clarity. If retained, make an explanatory note.

### 0.5.3.7 Virgules

<a name="0.5.3.7">0.5.3.7</a> Do not confuse a virgule (/) in gothic typefaces with a slash; replace it with a comma or omit it, as appropriate. Make an explanatory note if considered important.

### 0.5.3.8 Line endings

<a name="0.5.3.8">0.5.3.8</a> Omit hyphens or other marks of punctuation used to connect a single word divided between two lines or two portions of a line; transcribe as a single word, ignoring the punctuation. If the function of the hyphen is in doubt (e.g., if it might form part of a compound word), transcribe it.

>Example:  
><CITE>I discorsi di Nicolo Machiauelli, sopra la prima deca di Tito Liuio</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads (showing line endings)*:  
>I DISCORSI DI NICO-  
>LO MACHIAVELLI, SO-  
>PRA LA PRIMA DECA DI  
>TITO LIVIO  

Do not supply marks of punctuation to indicate line-breaks.

### 0.5.3.9 Punctuation substituting for letters

<a name="0.5.3.9">0.5.3.9</a> Transcribe as a single hyphen each distinct hyphen, dash, line, or underscore character used in the source, whether used as a substitute for one or more letters in a word, or for an entire word.

>Example:  
><CITE>Sec--t----s of st--te, the L----ds of the Ad------ty</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads*: Sec--t----s of st--te, the L----ds of the Ad------ty)

>Example:  
><CITE>Map illustrating the explorations of Pundit A- K- in Great Tibet, 1879-1882</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads*: Map illustrating the explorations of Pundit A___ K___ in Great Tibet, 1879-1882)

Transcribe asterisks as asterisks.

>Example:  
><CITE>par Mr. B***</CITE> 

>Example:  
><CITE>The conduct of the two B*****rs</CITE>

If the values of the missing letters are known, and the decoded form is considered important for identification or access then make a note for the decoded form.

>Example:  
>Title proper: <CITE>Clara H-d</CITE>  
>Note on title: <CITE>Clara H-d is Clara Hayward</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads*:  Clara H_____d)

If punctuation substituting for letters occurs in the first five words of the title proper (the first six words if the title begins with an article), and the values of the missing letters are known, then record a [variant title (1.25)](/DCRMR/title/Variant-title "variant title"). 

### 0.5.3.10 Punctuation indicating an abbreviation

<a name="0.5.3.10">0.5.3.10</a> Transcribe punctuation indicating an abbreviation, normalizing its form according to modern conventions.

>Example:  
><CITE>Printed & sold by J. Preston</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads*: Printed & sold by J: Preston)

When transcribing an abbreviated word that includes superscript or subscript characters, record the punctuation at the end of the word. (See also [Superscripts and subscripts 0.5.9](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.9 "Superscripts and subscripts").)

>Example:
><CITE>Ie. recueil nouveaux</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads*: I.<sup>E</sup> Recueil Nouveaux)

### 0.5.3.11 Quotation marks

Retain quotation marks that indicate dialogue. 

>Example:  
><CITE>"Miss, I have a monstrous crow to pluck with you!!”</CITE>

Do not supply quotation marks if not present in the source, except for the representation of speech balloons (see [0.5.3.12](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.3.12 "speech balloons")).

>Example:  
><CITE>Betty Boop. "Yes, sir, everything's ho-kee-doke, Betty's voice is normal again!"</CITE>  
>(*Comment*: Quoted text is inside a speech balloon in a comic strip.)

### 0.5.3.12 Speech balloons

Use quotation marks to represent speech balloons.

>Example:  
><CITE>Betty Boop. "Yes, sir, everything's ho-kee-doke, Betty's voice is normal again!"</CITE>  
>(*Comment*: Quoted text is inside a speech balloon in a comic strip.)
