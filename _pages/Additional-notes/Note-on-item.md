## 9.4.3 General rule

<a name="9.4.3.1">9.4.3.1</a> Make a Note on item for any special features of the item being described when they are considered important. Item-specific information is highly desirable in the context of rare materials cataloging, which puts greater emphasis on materials as artifacts than is usual in general cataloging practice. Notes on item can also provide warrant for recording relationships (e.g., names of former owners or binders) or genre terms (e.g., various kinds of provenance evidence, binding characteristics, etc.). Carefully distinguish Notes on item (those recording information about the item itself) from [Notes on manifestation](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-manifestation/) (those recording information about the manifestation in general).

<a name="9.4.3.2">9.4.3.2</a> For many older publications, however, it will not be readily ascertainable whether the characteristics of a single item are in fact shared by other exemplars of the manifestation. In case of doubt, consider that the characteristics of the item in hand are not shared by other items exemplifying the manifestation.

<a name="9.4.3.3">9.4.3.3</a> The extent and depth of detail provided in Note on item will be determined by the local policies of the cataloging agency. The rules set forth in this element are intended primarily to provide guidance and examples; the instructions are not to be seen as prescriptive.

<a name="9.4.3.4">9.4.3.4</a> Always include in Note on item a designation of the holding institution (e.g., a name, acronym, or code). Provide identification such as a designation of the item's physical location (e.g., a shelfmark) or an indication of the item's copy number (if the institution holds more than one exemplar of the manifestation) if considered important.

## 9.4.31 Statements relating to a substantially unchanged printing or state
