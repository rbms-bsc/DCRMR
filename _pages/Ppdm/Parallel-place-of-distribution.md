<a name="5.265.1.1">5.265.1.1</a> [Link to RDA Toolkit](https://access.rdatoolkit.org/Content/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-d791f2ed-ab22-3a5a-b659-61703a92c800){:target="_blank"}

<a name="5.265.1.2">5.265.1.2</a> [Sources of information](/DCRMR/ppdm/#5011-sources-of-information)

## 5.265.2 RDA definition and scope

<a name="5.265.2.1">5.265.2.1</a> A place of distribution in another language or script.

## 5.265.3 General rule

<a name="5.265.3.1">5.265.3.1</a> Take parallel places of distribution from the same source as the [Place of distribution](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-distribution/). Make a [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/) on parallel places of distribution found elsewhere if considered important (see [5.285.33.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.33.1)).

>**Example:**  
>Place of distribution: <CITE>Londini</CITE>  
>Parallel place of distribution: <CITE>Sold in London</CITE>  

<a name="5.265.3.2">5.265.3.2</a> For transposed elements, always make a [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/) to indicate the original position on the source (see [5.285.32.6](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.32.6)).

<a name="5.265.3.3">5.265.3.3</a> If the place of distribution appears in more than one language or script, transcribe the place in the language or script of the [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/) as [Place of distribution](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-distribution/). If this criterion does not apply, transcribe the place that appears first as [Place of distribution](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-distribution/).

<a name="5.265.3.4">5.265.3.4</a> Transcribe remaining places appearing on the same source as the [Place of distribution](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-distribution/) as Parallel places of distribution. If a parallel place of distribution is from a different source than the [Place of distribution](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-distribution/), make a [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/) if considered important (see [5.285.33.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.33.1)).

<a name="5.265.3.5">5.265.3.5</a> *Optionally*, if the parallel distribution places are considered too numerous to list exhaustively and some may be omitted without significant loss of identification, all after the third may be omitted. Supply in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the nature of the omitted information. Include the number of omitted places in the supplied phrase. Do not use the mark of omission.
