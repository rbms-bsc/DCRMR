## 5.315.2 RDA definition and scope

<a name="5.315.2.1">5.315.2.1</a> A place of manufacture in another language or script.

## 5.315.3 General rule

<a name="5.315.3.1">5.315.3.1</a> Take parallel places of manufacture from the same source as the [Place of manufacture](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-manufacture/). Make a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/) on parallel places of manufacture found elsewhere if considered important (see [5.34.33.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.33.1)).

<a name="5.315.3.2">5.315.3.2</a> For transposed elements, always make a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/) to indicate the original position on the source (see [5.34.34.7](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.34.7)).

<a name="5.315.3.3">5.315.3.3</a> If the place of manufacture appears in more than one language or script, transcribe the place in the language or script of the [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/) as [Place of manufacture](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-manufacture/). If this criterion does not apply, transcribe the place that appears first as [Place of manufacture](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-manufacture/).

<a name="5.315.3.4">5.315.3.4</a> Transcribe remaining places appearing on the same source as the [Place of manufacture](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-manufacture/) as Parallel places of manufacture. If a parallel place of manufacture is from a different source than the [Place of manufacture](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-manufacture/), make a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/) if considered important (see [5.34.33.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.33.1)).

>**Example:**  
>Place of manufacture: <CITE>Birminghamiae</CITE>  
>Parallel place of manufacture: <CITE>Printed at Birmingham</CITE>  

<a name="5.315.3.5">5.315.3.5</a> *Optionally*, if the parallel manufacture places are considered too numerous to list exhaustively and some may be omitted without significant loss of identification, all after the third may be omitted. Supply in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the nature of the omitted information. Include the number of omitted places in the supplied phrase. Do not use the mark of omission.
